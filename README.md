Practical Application Assignment 5.1: Will the Customer Accept the Coupon?

You will find the Jupyter file in this github folder. Note that I portions of the project were AI assisted (ChatGPT 3.5).  

I conducted additional analysis of the Coffee House coupons with the following findings:

1)  Drivers traveling in the moring are more likely to accept a Coffee House coupon that other times.  Early afternoon drivers were the second most likely group to accept the coupon.
2)  Drivers that are driving without no urgent direction are more likely to accept a Coffee House coupon than drivers who are driving home or to work.
3)  Marital status does not affect the likelihood of accepting a Coffee House coupon, except the widows are less likely, which may reflect age rather than marital status.

Based on these finding, a Coffee House coupon delivery app may want to focus its efforts on drivers in the morning and early afteroon.  It would likely be difficult to target based on the purpose of the drive, so focusing on time is likely more practical.
